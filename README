Data Visualisation - Ford Gobike Dataset

Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.

Summary of findings :

1.Bike Ride Duration Time: The origianl duration data has right skew issue - bike durations range from less than 1 minute to more than 1400 minutes with median at around 9 min and mean at around 13 mins. We have to do some data transformation (I used log transformation) to make data visualization and data interpretation easiler.

2.Bike Ride trends and Biker types:
1)Trip duration are longer for customers than subscribers.
2)We can see that in general subsribers are more than customers on every day of the week. We can also see that the morning and evening times see the highest count of bikers, with maximum number of bike rides on the weekends.
3)'Customer' bikers bike longer on average compared to 'Subscriber' bikers.
4)There are more bikers on Saturday and on Sundays on average.

5)We find that Tuesday at 5:00 PM has the highest biker counts across 7 days, 24 hours.  
6) 5:00 PM has the most 'Subscriber' bikers compared to other hours. It also has the most 'Customer' bikers compared to other hours.
7) Tuesday has the most 'Subscriber' bikers compared to other days. Saturday has the most 'Customer' bikers compared to other days.
